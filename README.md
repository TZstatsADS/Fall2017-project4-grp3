+ Project summary: The goal of this project is to compare a pair of algorithms from the collaborative filtering literature. One of the algorithms is a model-based and the other is a memory-based algorithm. For the model-based we used a naive bayseian clustering approach, with 4 clusters and a hal-life of 8 itens, achieving a rank score of 47.28 (best parameters have been chosen based on cross-validation).
